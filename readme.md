![The Car Club](img/Capture.JPG "The Car Club")

The idea to create a car logos memory game *The Car Club* came from my son who explores and learnes car makes while outside on a walk. To make this project more attractive for everyone I was looking for an API which would fetch different logos from manufacturers all over the world for each game.

# 1. UX 👌
## 1.1 Strategy 👪

The goal of this project is to provide fun for everyone, to train player's memory and to present all car logos from around the world. Intuitive design and consistent navigation will satisfy user needs.

### User stories

With an agile approach I will be focusing on both external and internal clients.

As user I would like to:

- be able to set difficulty level - also in training mode
- see the time needed and flips made
- see various logos each time to make the game more interesting
- quit the game before time is up
- contact car club to submit feedback
- see Car Club address
- easy nav menu
- responsive design for mobile devices

As a website owner I would like to:

 - display my address on Google maps
 - attract users with intuitive design
 - be accessible via contact form

## 1.2 Scope  ❓

The scope will define what features will be implemented into our project based on user stories. For Minimum Viable Product the following features were identified:

- attractive Welcome screen
- intuitive menu
- how to play instructions
- game itself with three levels of difficulty
- timer and a flips counter
- highest score table
- email function
- Google maps location

To be implemented:
- JSON file with car logo url's
- All car logos gallery with basic data about manufacturer
